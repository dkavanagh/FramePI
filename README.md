FramePI
=======

This project is to build a digital picture frame that you can see from across the room, much like regular artwork. We'll use an inexpensive 20+ inch LCD monitor and RaspberryPI board.

The software will consist of 2 parts. 1 is the image viewing code and the other is the configuration Web UI.
